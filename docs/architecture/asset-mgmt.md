# Asset management

Document the inventory assets:

- Sequential numbers for equipment that are unique company-wide
- Labels for straightforward identification
- Barcodes to enable simple scanning with barcode readers
- QR codes for additional data, use of tables and mobile devices as scanners

Keep the asset documentation of all spare items available in the workplace.
