# Physical infrastructure

> Location-based documentation

Each object that corresponds to a location needs to be documented once. All
other objects are linked to it relationally.

All of these can be physical locations:

- A workplace (with which equipment is associated)
- A building
- A floor (which contains rooms)
- A room
- A campus
- A city
- A state
- A country

| **Type** | **Building/Floor/Room/Rack** | **Description** | **More information** |
| -------- | -----------------------------| --------------- | ----------------  |
| {installation type} | {building}/{floor}/{room}/{rack} | {Description} | {Link to the relevant installation steps section} |

## Floor Plans

Gives you a graphical representation, and photos (eg of building plans) can also
be stored in the system. Later on, mark out the exact locations of systems, racks
– as well as your WLAN coverage.

## Rack management

Document the equipment slotted into your racks including unit details.

## Facility management

Don’t restrict your documentation to just rooms: your inventory should include your
workplaces, users, extensions, security, shipping address and local contacts.

- Contact person (for access or alarms)
- Phone number of the extension in the server room
- Exact address
