# Applications and services

## Applications

Document any applications installed, including configuration changes and dependencies.

## Services

Examples of IT services include directory services, name resolution, firewalls, antivirus,
database services, etc.

The relationships: these bind objects into dependencies and thus into a hierarchy.
The 'service tree' often referred to provides details of the elements that must (or
may) be present so that the service works is fully functional to its capabilities.

Automated creation of the list of services currently running can be highly
informative - especially in terms of services that should not be running.

## IT services

Document services provided by the IT department as well.
